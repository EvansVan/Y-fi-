This is a script that i intend to use to access my home router and change the wifi password using python. The script will select a password from a textfile containing pre-selected passwords.

I am using the python selenium package for web control and os for file management. 

I also want to leverage the use of api's in this process to enable me to have a list of number of house memn=bers who can be added or removed, to whom the password is shared via text after every change.
